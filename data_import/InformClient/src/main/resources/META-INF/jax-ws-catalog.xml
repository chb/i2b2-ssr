The sole purpose of this file is to allow us to use local wsdls to generate our proxies.  This insulates us from having to
rebuild or regenerate the wsdl bindings every time we want to point it to a new service endpoint.  This effectively just works as
a piece of indirection.  The only reason we're down this road is because the default mechanism that wsimport uses
that takes in a 'local wsdl location' only knows how to look for the wsdl via absolute paths which will croak if you
try to deploy it.  You'd assume there'd be some nice facility to do classpath searches or relative paths, but you would be wrong.
